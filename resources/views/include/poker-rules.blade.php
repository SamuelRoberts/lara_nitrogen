       <li><p><em>No Limit Texas Hold ‘Em (NLHE)</em>No Limit Hold ‘Em is poker as it was meant to be played, no caps or maximum bets on hands, and players go all in and all out for the win!</p></li>
       <li><p><em>NLHE Rules</em>

        Each Player is dealt two “pocket” cards. The dealer is designated by a white chip marked with a letter D.<br><br>
        The “small blind” (the player to the immediate left of the dealer) automatically contributes half of the necessary ante or “blind” to the pot. The “big blind” (the player to the immediate left of the small blind) automatically contributes the full ante or “blind” to the pot. A round of betting commences, during which each player (in clockwise order) has an opportunity to: a) match the blind (the minimum amount of mBTC necessary to participate in the hand); b) raise (bet a larger amount of money than is necessary to participate in the hand, thereby forcing other players to match that amount if they wish to continue), or c) fold (refuse to match the blinds or raises and thereby withdraw from that particular hand). Once the action circles around the table, the small blind must pay the remaining half of his/her blind as well as any additional raises in order to continue playing. If a big or small blind will not or cannot match any raises and folds, their blinds are lost to the pot.<br><br>
        When all blinds or bets have been matched by players wishing to remain in the hand, play moves on to the “flop”. The flop is the revealing of three cards in the middle of the table to all players. Following the flop, a round of betting commences with the remaining player to the nearest left of the dealer. Each player has the option to: a) check (not bet any additional mBTC and pass the option on to the next player); b) bet/raise (place into the pot an additional amount of mBTC which must be matched by any other player wishing to remain in the game), or c) fold (refuse to match any additional bets or raises and withdraw from the hand, losing all mBTC previously contributed to the pot through the course of the hand). If all players involved in a hand choose to check, the hand moves on without any additional mBTC being contributed to the pot. Otherwise, all bets/raises must be matched by players wishing to continue before the hand continues. Should all players but one choose to fold their hands and not match a bet, the player who has made that high bet wins the hand.<br><br>
        The “turn” is the revealing of the fourth card to the table. The turn is followed by another round of betting that follows the same formula detailed in part iii. Remember, this is No Limit Hold ‘Em, and players may risk any amount of the mBTC which they have accrued throughout the course of the game. When the hand has been checked down or all bets/raises matched the hand moves on to the “river”.<br><br>
        The river card is the fifth and final card revealed to the table. It’s revealing begins a final round of betting. The players who remain to contest the hand after all betting then have their cards revealed and the high hand wins the pot. In the event of a draw (equal hands held by two or more players) the pot is split accordingly.<br><br>
        After the conclusion of a hand, the dealer chip shifts clockwise to the left (the former small blind will now be the dealer) and the process repeats.

  </p></li>
  <li><p><em>Limit Texas Hold 'Em (LHE)</em>Limit Hold ‘Em has the same process of play as that of No Limit. The only difference is that there is a cap or maximum bet established that no player can exceed at any point during a game. The maximum bet is identified in the description of each table in the Synergy Poker Lobby. Limit Hold ‘Em is a great way to be introduced to poker, fewer all-in bets and a more conservative, but equally savvy style of play mean a great way to stay involved and improve one’s skill.</p></li>
  <li><p><em>LHE Rules</em>

        Limit Hold ‘Em has the same process of play as that of No Limit. The only difference is that there is a cap or maximum bet established that no player can exceed at any point during a game.

Limit Hold ‘Em is a great way to be introduced to poker, fewer all-in bets and a more conservative, but equally savvy style of play mean a great way to stay involved and improve one’s skill.

  </p></li>
  <li><p><em>Omaha (Omaha Hi)</em>Omaha is a fun and exciting way to play poker with a twist. The standard rules and regulations are much the same as Hold ‘Em poker, and those who are familiar should have an easy time picking up Omaha. Hand values and ranking remain the same, as does betting and the general structure of the game. The differences are explained below.</p></li>
  <li><p><em>Omaha Hi Rules</em>

        Each player is dealt four cards at the beginning of each hand, rather than the customary two. All four of those cards are private and hidden from the other players.<br><br>
        The play structure of each hand remains the same: dealer, small and big blinds, and rounds of betting all have the same structure as outlined under Hold ‘Em rules. (Omaha games are limit games to add structure to a game where hands and combinations of cards can change rapidly)<br><br>
        The goal of Omaha is to for players to create the best hand possible by using two of the four cards from their hand and three of the five cards revealed to the table. Players must abide by this rule and not use three cards from their hand and two from those revealed on the table or any other combination.

  </p></li>
  <li><p><em>Telesina</em>Telesina is a variant of 5 Card Stud, and is played using a deck of only 32 cards rather than the traditional 52. More common in Europe it might be a fun way to spice up your poker experience!</p></li>
  <li><p><em>Telesina Rules</em>

        A maximum of six players can play telesina at once. Two cards are dealt to each player. The first card dealt to each player will be concealed while the second card is face up for everyone to see. The first betting round will then commence. The player who hold the highest card after the first deal leads the betting.<br><br>
        After the initial deal and round of betting, three more cards are dealt to each player face-up and visible to all players. A round of betting follows each deal, consistent with most varieties of poker.<br><br>
        The sixth card to be dealt (following the initial two hole cards and following three visible cards to each player) is the “Vela Card” which appears in the center of the table. Every player still in the hand is able this card. Then the final round of betting will commence.<br><br>
        Unique to Telesina is a variation in hand values. For a game of Telesina, a flush is valued more highly than a full house. A full ranking of Telesina hands follows:<br>
        Straight Flush<br>
        Four of a Kind<br>
        Flush<br>
        Full House<br>
        Straight<br>
        Three of a Kind<br>
        Two Pairs<br>
        One Pair<br>
        Highest Card

       <li><p><em>Synergy Collusion Policy</em>

        Collusion is a form of cheating where two or more players work together in a poker game to gain an advantage over one or more players at the table. This is sometimes done by a single person (using more than one account) or by multiple people (each using their own account). It can happen in cash games as well as SnGs and tournaments.<br><br>

        Our methods for detecting collusion are based on how a hand of poker is played. If our system detects that a hand may have been played in an unusual way, it will be flagged to be reviewed by security. A manual review of the full hand will then take place to determine if there was collusion.<br><br>

        In addition to our own reviews, all player reports of collusion will be fully investigated by our staff.<br><br>

        Collusion is strictly forbidden at Synergy.<br><br>

        If a player or team of players is found to be colluding in any way at our poker tables, their accounts may be permanently banned from playing poker at Synergy.<br><br>

        These exists no second chance policy for collusion, and ignorance of the above policy has no effect on the consequences
