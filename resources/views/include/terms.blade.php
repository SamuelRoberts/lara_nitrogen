        <li><p><em>What is your minimum bet?</em>0.001 BTC</p></li>
        <li><p><em>What is your maximum bet?</em>Maximum bet amounts vary based on a lot of factors (like sport, league or how far away the start time is for example). For transparency, all of our limits are displayed next to the bet so that you know how much you can wager. This maximum "wager amount" can be either the RISK or the TO-WIN value. For example, if the maximum wager was displayed as 1.0 BTC, but the odds were (1.500/-200), you could still risk 2.0 BTC to win 1.0 BTC.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>I made a mistake with a bet, can you change it or cancel it?</em>As per our rules and terms; we can never change, modify or cancel any bet confirmed by a user. You must always check your betslip before confirming. If you are ever unsure about what wagers you have, you can check this under menu Synergy -> My Wagers. You can also turn on email notifications to get an email for every wager you place.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Why is my wager not graded yet?</em>Some sports and leagues must have their results verified by our team to ensure correct results. Sports especially like eSports or foreign sports teams do not always have official pages, or sometimes the posted results are incorrect on one source and take multiple sources to verify the winner/outcome.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>How long do withdraws take?</em>Withdraws are very fast in most cases. Sometimes our security might detect that your account has been hacked or accessed by a 3rd party in which case your withdraw may need a manual review.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>How do you decide on the odds to offer?</em>Our odds are grabbed from various sources and are also subject to change depending on any action we receive on a particular game. Our policy is that you will be paid out here more, than anywhere else on the internet for your bitcoin wager. If you find better odds elsewhere, please let us know by creating a support ticket!</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Why are your limits low, I want to wager more?</em>While it is our strict policy that users do not create more than one account, we have had many people abuse this rule and therefore NEW accounts will now start with low limits. Long-standing accounts can request to have their limits increased by creating a support ticket. While we do our best to accomodate everyone's limit requests, there mamy be a long queue during this transition period. We thank you for your patience.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>What do I do if I have a problem that I couldn't solve after reading this FAQ, the Rules page and the Terms page or what if I just have a feature I want to request?</em>Create a support ticket. You can do this through the menu on the left under Synergy -> Support.</p></li>
