										<strong>Do I need to complete all the challenges to win?</strong>
										<br/>
										No. You can still win the prize draws for the challenges you have completed. However, you will not be eligible to enter or win the grand prize draw without completing all 8 challenges.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>Do I need my parlay wagers to be on certain bet types?</strong>
										<br/>
										No. You may wager on spreads, totals, and moneylines for the contest.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>Is there a minimum wager amount?</strong>
										<br/>
										Yes. For a betslip to be eligible, each bet (or betslip in the case of the parlay challenges) must have a minimum stake of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 btc for the Bronze, Silver, and Gold challenges respectively.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>Will placing a bet automatically earn me a challenge tile? </strong>
										<br/>
										No. In order for your tile to appear, you must share your betslip or hand of poker (that completes any of the challenges) by sending them to us on <a href="" >Twitter</a> or <a href="#" >Facebook</a>, using the hashtag #10xChallenge. Only betslips and hands shared before the end of the promotion (Sunday June 7th @ 23:59 UTC) will count towards the contest.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>What if I have a betslip that completes 2 challenges?</strong>
										<br/>
										Only ONE challenge tile will be awarded per betslip. Betslips that complete more than one challenge will be credited in the order of which tile is first.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>Can I make 2 identical betslips that complete 2 tiles?</strong>
										<br/>
										Yes. While each individual betslip will only count for ONE tile, betslips that are identical can be applied to the next tile.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>For parlay challenges can I submit larger parlays?</strong>
										<br/>
										Yes. You may apply larger parlays to any valid challenge (by specifying the 10x Challenge when sharing).
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>I've shared my betslip / poker hand, how long will it take for the challenge tiles to appear on my account or on the leaderboard? </strong>
										<br/>
										After sharing your betslip or hand of poker via <a href="" >Twitter</a> or <a href="" >Facebook</a>, please allow 24 hours for the challenge tiles to appear on the leaderboard and for any free bets to appear in your account.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>When does this promotion end?</strong>
										<br/>
										All bets must be on matches with a start date prior to Sunday, June 7th at 18:00 UTC. Final slips must be shared by 23:59 UTC, Sunday June 7th, 2015 in order to count towards the promotion.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>When will the prize awarded? </strong>
										<br/>
										Any free bets you receive by completing gold challenges will be awarded within 24 hrs of sharing the betslip. Winners of the prize draws will be selected on June 8th at 1:00 UTC and announced via Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and our BitcoinTalk thread within 24 hours.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>Why don't I see my User # on the leaderboard yet? How come my challenge tile isn't showing yet?
										</strong>
										<br/>
										Due to the nature of the challenges, betslips and poker hands are added manually. Please allow up to 24 hours for your challenge tiles to be awarded. If you have additional issues or questions please create a support ticket.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>Can I enter the contest with multiple accounts? </strong>
										<br/>
										Absolutely NOT. We have extremely sophisticated methods for detecting multiple accounts in our system. Any user or team of users that attempt to defraud the contest by using more than one account will forfeit all promotion prizes and be banned from the contest. Any prizes won from fraud accounts will be split among all remaining prize winners.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<strong>Is there a deadline to submit my betslips?</strong>
										<br/>
										<u>Yes, at stated above (at the very start of the contest), betslips must be shared by 23:59 UTC, June 7th, 2015 in order to count towards the promotion. No exceptions will be made. All betslips submitted AFTER this time will not count towards the promotion and those users WILL NOT have the tile unlocked.</u>

							<strong>Back by popular demand!</strong><br/>
							SynergySports is pleased to re-announce our fun and unique Go for Gold Challenge! We've made some adjustments based on your feedback so please read the update rules below!
							<br/><br/>
							During the month of October, place wagers corresponding to the challenges listed below. Each challenge completed earns you a letter towards spelling out the word SynergySports. The player with the MOST letters collected by the end of the promotion will win <strong>2 BTC</strong>. For full contest details and rules please keep reading below!

							<br/><strong>What are the challenges?</strong><br/>

								<div class="promo-sport-challenge-item">
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-letter promo-sport-tile-n"></div>
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-description"><strong>DPAD's GUARANTEE</strong> Share a winning betslip which is a 12-team (or larger) parlay. The total parlay odds must be at least 21.000 (+2000) odds or more (ie. 22.000 (+2100) odds would still count). Alternatively you may also just submit any betslip (winning or losing) which meets none or some of the criteria just mentioned, but confidently claim that it qualifies anyway.</div>
								</div>
								<div class="promo-sport-challenge-item">
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-letter promo-sport-tile-i"></div>
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-description"><strong>STANDER'S SPECIAL</strong> Share a winning betslip which contains 7 winning eSports bets. It does not need to be a parlay, but all bets must be winners. Slips that contain a losing bet still qualify, as long as there are at least 7 wins.</div>
								</div>
								<div class="promo-sport-challenge-item">
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-letter promo-sport-tile-t"></div>
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-description"><strong>VGN'S VIG</strong> Share a winning betslip which is a 5-team parlay. Each individual leg of the parlay must be at least odds of 4.000 (+300) or more (ie. 5.000 (+400) odds would still count)</div>
								</div>
								<div class="promo-sport-challenge-item">
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-letter promo-sport-tile-r"></div>
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-description"><strong>TWOHUNDRED'S TERROR</strong> Share a winning betslip which is a 10-team parlay. Each individual leg of the parlay must be at least odds of 2.000 (+100) or more (ie. 3.000 (+200) odds would still count)</div>
								</div>
								<div class="promo-sport-challenge-item">
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-letter promo-sport-tile-o"></div>
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-description"><strong>THE DUAL LONGSHOT</strong> Share a winning betslip which is a 2-team parlay consisting ONLY of football. Each individual leg of the parlay must be at least odds of 5.000 (+400) or more (ie. 6.000 (+500) odds would still count)</div>
								</div>
								<div class="promo-sport-challenge-item">
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-letter promo-sport-tile-g"></div>
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-description"><strong>HALF THE ALPHABET</strong> Share a winning betslip which is a winning 13-team Parlay. The team names in the parlay must each start with a different letter of the alphabet. For team names that contain cities/countries, only the team name will count (ie. New England Patriots = "P" vs St. Louis Rams = "R"). For team names that are location only, then they will count based on their first letter (ie. Monte Carlo = "M" vs Paris = "P"). Either the winning team or the losing team can be used to grant you the letter, but the wager itself must win. For duplicate letters across multiple legs, we will always attempt to choose the combination that gives you the most unique set of letters.</div>

								<div class="promo-sport-challenge-item">
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-letter promo-sport-tile-e"></div>
									<div class="promo-sport-challenge-description"><strong>LUCKY FOOTBALL WAGER</strong> Share a winning betslip in which the wager amount is equal to the sum of the scores of both teams (divided by 10,000), using football only. For example, if you wagered on Oct 13th's NFL game (Rams = 17 vs 49ers = 31) an amount of 0.0048 then you would have a winning slip. (Since 17+31 = 48 and 48 / 10000 = 0.0048)</div>
