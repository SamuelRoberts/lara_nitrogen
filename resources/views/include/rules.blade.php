            						<div class="rules-list">
            							<ol>
            								<li><p><em>Obviously "bad" lines or odds</em>SynergySports reserves the right to cancel any bet that was made on an obviously "bad" line or odd.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Bets made after the event has started</em>Although we will try our best to prevent the listing of any started event, SynergySports reserves the right to cancel any bet that was made after the event started. This rule does not constitute an opportunity to 'freeroll' the sportsbook, bets made a few seconds into a match in which no significant events taking place (ie. the first seconds of an eSports starcraft match) does not give cause for bets to be cancelled. All judgement is at the sole discretion of SynergySports. A player will never benefit by betting a started match with the intention to reference this rule when it loses.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Grading bets</em>Bets are graded only after the event is final.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Overturned and protested decisions</em>The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the events conclusion. SynergySports does not recognize any "overturned" or "protested" decisions.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Age restrictions</em>No one under the age of 18 is allowed to make a bet.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Bet limits</em>Minimum and maximum bet amounts on all events will be determined by SynergySports and are subject to change without prior written notice. SynergySports also reserves the right to adjust the limits on individual accounts. The maximum payout for a single bet slip is 100 BTC. For parlays, the maximum payout on a bet slip is 50 BTC.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Personal Information</em>SynergySports assumes that the information given upon signup, settings and cashier is accurate and up to date.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Incorrect account balance</em>In the event that funds are credited to a customer's account in error, the customer should notify SynergySports as soon as possible. Any bets made with these erroneous funds are subject to be cancelled.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Placing bets</em>Members are responsible for their own account transactions. Please be sure to review your bets for any mistakes prior to pressing the confirm button. Once a transaction is complete, it cannot be changed. SynergySports does not take responsibility for any missing or duplicate bets made by the client. Clients may review their bets on the "My Wagers" page after each transaction, to ensure that all confirmed wagers were accepted.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Disputes</em>Disputes must be submitted within seven (7) days from the date the bet in question has been graded. No claims will be honored after this period.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Account security</em>Each client is wholly responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their login credentials. Any transactions confirmed by third parties shall stand. In the even that a customer suspects a third party may have their password, the customer may ask SynergySports to temporarily lock their account.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Betting on ties</em>In some games where a draw (or tie) price is offered (for example, most soccer games), if the event results in a tie only the bettors that bet the draw will be paid as winners. Those who wagered on either participant to win will lose their bet.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Cancelling accounts</em>Although rare, SynergySports reserves the right to suspend or cancel a customer account without prior notice and return all funds.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Fraud</em>You will not cause any transactions to be made at SynergySports that are not in good faith in an attempt to defraud the company, regardless of whether or not it causes us harm. If SynergySports believes that any customer has intentionally acted in bad faith or has engaged in fraudulent activity, SynergySports reserves the right to take any steps necessary. SynergySports has the right to cancel any bet perceived to be placed in a fraudulent manner in order to circumvent our bet limits and/or system regulations. In the event that your account receives funds in error, SynergySports reserves the rights to recover these funds at any time.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Multiple Accounts</em>You may not, under any circumstances, create multiple accounts for the purpose of defrauding SynergySports. This includes, but is not limited to, multiple accounts created to circumvent our betting limits or multiple accounts created to take advantage of our affiliate program. Accounts created to defraud SynergySports, as decided in our sole discretion, run the risk of having the offending bet(s) cancelled from those accounts and/or those accounts permanently closed. In the event that your account receives funds in error and need to be recovered, SynergySports reserves the right to treat multiple accounts belonging to a single user as one when recovering funds.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Contact information</em>SynergySports identifies and communicates with our clients via the email address registered in their account. It is the responsibility of the customer to maintain an active and unique email account and to ensure that this email address is up to date on the settings page. Each client is responsible for maintaining the security of their email account to prevent the use by any third party. SynergySports is not responsible for any damages or losses to result from communications between SynergySports and the client using their registered email address. The customer's private information will be protected in compliance with our privacy policy.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Wrong sport or league</em>An event will take bets regardless if it is placed under the wrong league or sport. As long as the two participants are correct, all bets will still stand.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Date of events</em>If an event is not played on the same date as announced by the governing body, then all wagers on the event are cancelled. If an event is posted by SynergySports with an incorrect date, all bets will stand based on the date announced by the governing body.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Deposit and Withdraw fees</em>Bitcoin users pay no fees for deposits or withdraws.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Identity verification</em>SynergySports reserves the right to request valid proof of identification from all players.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Self exclusion</em>Customers have the right to self-exclude themselves from SynergySports.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Promotional Funds</em>Any funds added to your account via a Promotion or Bonus have no rollover requirement and are available for immediate withdraw, unless otherwise noted.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Follow the rules!</em>By opening an account with SynergySports, customers enter into an agreement with SynergySports to abide by the site rules.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Sport specific rules</em>If a sport specific rule contradicts a general rule, then the general rule will not apply.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Changes to rules</em>All rules and regulations are subject to changes and revisions by SynergySports without prior written notice.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>No rule</em>In the case where no listed rule can be applied, or no rule makes sense in a given situation (unique or undefined situation) SynergySports reserves the right to apply their sole judgement on how to handle such situation. All judgements in this case will be handled consistently across all users/accounts.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Dead Heat Rules</em>In the case of ties for multi-outcome props, dead heat rules will apply. For more information, please see <a href="http://www.betting-explained.com/dead-heat-rules-explained/" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p></li>

            							<ol>
            								<li><p><em>Number of Teams</em>You may select upto 20 teams in a parlay.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Limits</em>The parlay leg with the lowest limit will define the limit for the entire parlay.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Restrictions</em>SynergySports may exclude any event, league or sport from being able to be parlayed at any time. The maximum payout in one calendar day for any parlay is 50 BTC.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Pushes and Cancellations</em>If one or more legs of a parlay are pushed or cancelled, the parlay odds are recalculated (reduced) based on the remaining legs that have action. Therefore, a push or cancellation in a two-team parlay is paid as a straight bet on the remaining leg using the original risk amount to calculate the win amount.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Correlated Parlays</em>SynergySports reserves the right to cancel any parlays that it finds correlated. Correlated parlays are invalid parlays that attempt to select two legs such that if one bets wins, it increases the odds of the other bet winning. Examples of correlated parlays include selecting a team to win both the first half and the full game. Another example would be an eSports player to win a map as well as their team to win the whole match. You may also reference Terms and Conditions 12g.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Invalid Parlays</em>In the event that a player is able to create an obviously invalid parlay as determined solely by SynergySports, SynergySports reserves the right to cancel the parlay. An example of an invalid Parlay would be adding the same outcome to the betslip twice.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Circumventing Limits</em>You may not use parlay wagers to increase your exposure to single game outcomes more than is allowed via a maximum straight bet. Redundant parlay wagers made with the intention of circumventing single game betting limits will be canceled. Redundant parlays made to circumvent the maximum payout limits will be canceled as well.</p></li>

            								<li><p><em>General</em>All Live lines are for the complete game score, unless otherwise specified.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Guarantee of Lines</em>We cannot guarantee a line at any point in the game. All lines will be offered at the complete discretion of SynergySports.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Sport Specific Rules</em>Live Betting wagers are decided according to any Live Wagering rules specified for that sport. If no rules are listed specifically for Live lines, then all standard rules for that sport will apply.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Mistake Lines</em>SynergySports reserves the right to cancel any wager made on an obvious mistake line.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>No Rule</em>In the case where no listed rule can be applied, or no rule makes sense in a given situation (unique or undefined situation) SynergySports reserves the right to apply their sole judgement on how to handle such situation. All judgments in this case will be handled consistently across all users/accounts.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Incorrect Lines</em>We will use our best effort to ensure that lines and odds are not being offered incorrectly or after the conclusion of an event. However, we reserve the right to cancel live wagers placed when the outcome of said wagers is already known, or when the lines and odds have not updated appropriately given a change in the event. Wagers will be canceled at the sole discretion of SynergySports, and any such adjustments will be made consistently across all accounts.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>NFL/NCAAf Props</em>For the "Team to Score Next" prop, the points after try (extra points, and 2 point conversions) are considered part of the scoring touchdown, and not the next score.</p></li>

            								<li><p><em>General</em>For betting purposes, winners and losers are determined by the final score (including overtime, if applicable). If the event has a final result of a draw (tie), moneyline wagers will be graded as a push.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Game Time</em>All Aussie Rules matches must go at least 80 minutes to be valid. Pre-season matches that are scheduled to play less time are an exception.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Postponed Games</em>If an Aussie Rules match is postponed for more than 48 hours from its original starting time, all bets on the match will be cancelled and monies will be refunded to your account.</p></li>

            								<li><p><em>Head to Head Matchups</em>In the event of a match starting but not being completed for any reason, all wagers on the outcome of the match will be void. If any player withdraws from either a singles, doubles or mixed doubles match before it is finished, the bets will be refunded, regardless of the point in the match the players resign.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Set Betting</em>If a Badminton match is not completed due to player retirement or disqualification, all Set wagers will be considered void. Such wagers will be canceled and monies refunded. Set Winner: This wager refers to the winner of a specific set in a match. The respective set must be completed for bets to stand.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Team Matchups</em>All wagers stand on the results of a team match, even if one or more individual matches are settled by walk over decisions due to resignation of players. If a player is changed in a singles or a doubles match, the bets on this individual match will be cancelled and monies refunded. All bets on the outcome of a team match will, however, not be affected by any player substitutions or changes in the team line ups.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Delays and Suspended Games</em>If a Badminton match is completed, all bets stand as written. Any delay in the start of a match will not affect the standing of wagers, nor will a suspension, as long as play is resumed and the match completed. In the event that a Badminton match is shortened by tournament officials, the leader at the time of stoppage shall be declared the winner.</p></li>

            								<li><p><em>Game Time</em>If the length of a match is changed for any reason from 2 x 45 minutes to 3 x 30 minutes then all wagers stand except all bets that refer to either the first or the second half.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Change of Venue</em>If the venue of a match is changed, all bets stand.</p></li>

            							<ol>
            								<li><p><em>Over/Under and Spread Wagers</em>When betting on total runs (over/under) or the spread the game must go 9 innings (or 8.5 if the home team is ahead) to be valid. If a game is cancelled or suspended in extra innings, the score will be determined after the last full inning unless the home team scores to tie, or takes the lead in the bottom half of the (latest partial) inning, in which case the score is determined at the time the game is called.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Official Game Result</em>The result of the game is official after 5 innings of play unless the home team is leading after 4.5 innings. If a game is called or suspended, the winner is determined by the score after the last full inning unless the home team scores to tie, or take the lead in the bottom half of the (latest partial) inning, in which case the winner is determined by the score at the time the game is called. Bets will be refunded if the home team ties the game and it is suspended. This is not the case for 1st half betting, where a game must go the FULL 5 innings to be considered valid.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Suspended Playoff Game</em>In the case of a suspended playoff game that will be resumed in a span of 96 hours after its suspension, all bets are valid and will be graded after the completion of the game. If the game is not completed with the 96 hours following the time of the suspension, then all bets are cancelled.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Pitching Changes</em>All bets stand regardless of any pitcher changes. Some prop bets may list the starting pitcher. In this case, the listed pitcher must start for these bets to have action.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Postponed and Delayed Games</em>In the event of a delay, as long as the event is played on the scheduled day, all bets have action. If inclement weather (or similar delay) pushes the start time past midnight local time, but the game is still played, all bets have action. If the game is rescheduled, all bets are cancelled.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Mercy Rule</em>In any case where a Mercy Rule is invoked, games will be considered to be complete. Games wagers on runlines, totals, team totals and money line will have action.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>1st Half Betting</em>Wagers on baseball 1st halves (5 innings) are decided based on the score at the end of <strong>five full innings</strong>. If a game does not go five full innings, all 1st half wagers (5 innings) will be cancelled. As soon as 5 full innings have been completed, all wagers on the first half (5 innings) will stand. In the case of Double Result Props the first half is considered the first 4 innings.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Grand Salami</em>All scheduled games must go at least 9 innings (8.5 if the home team is winning). If any scheduled game is canceled or stopped before the completion of 8.5 innings, all wagers on the Baseball Grand Salami will be canceled.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Quality Pitching</em>For betting purposes, Quality Pitching Prop refers to the total number of runs conceded after a specified number of innings.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Extra Clarification and Examples</em>The intention of rules #1 and #2 is that in the case where the away team scores some runs in extra innings, the home team should get their 3 outs in the bottom of that inning to also score at least that many runs. So if say in the top of the 14th inning, the away team was to score 4 runs, then the only way any of those would count towards the 'official score' for grading purposes is if the home team was able to also have an opportunity to complete the bottom of the 14th with at least 4 runs or more, OR with 3 outs in the bottom of the 14th. So, to further illustrate this point, if the home team scored 2 runs and had 2 outs and the game was called, the official score would NOT include this inning since the game was suspended without the 3rd out in the bottom of the 14th and without the home team scoring at least 4 runs.</p></li>

            								<li><p><em>Period Betting</em>If the entire game is not completed, bets on periods will be valid as long as the entire period is played.</p></li>
            								<li><p><em>Final Score</em>Winners and losers of basketball games are determined by the final score (including overtime), provided the game has gone the minimum time as specified above.

            								<li><p><em>Changes to Totals</em>If the announced number of maps/rounds is changed (eg. “Best of 3” instead of “Best of 5”) all bets on the spread or total are refunded. If new lines reflecting the change are available, these new wagers will stand. All wagers on the ML will stand regardless of these changes.
