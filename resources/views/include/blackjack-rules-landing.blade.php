								<li><p>
									<em>The Objective</em>In a game of blackjack the objective is to defeat the dealer’s hand by obtaining a hand of cards totalling nearer to 21 than the dealer without going over that number. The individual players do not face off against each other, but merely need to beat the dealer’s had to win.
								</p></li>

								<li><p><em>Card Values</em> In blackjack, cards have specific numerical values that are key to your strategy and success as you play.
									<br><br>
									Aces are a unique card, and can be worth 1 or 11 (as a player, you do not need to specify which, rather it will be altered to create the best outcome for you).
									<br><br>
									Cards numbered 2 through 9 are worth their numerical face value.
									<br><br>
									The 10, Jack, Queen and King are all worth 10.
									<br><br>
									<i>It is important to note that suits have no impact on the value of cards</i>
								</p></li>

								<li><p><em>Number of Decks</em>The number of decks depends on the rule variant you are playing. Please click the 'Rules' button on the Blackjack page to find out exactly how many decks are used for that variant. </p></li>

								<li><p><em>Placing a Bet</em> Prior to the cards being dealt, you will be given the opportunity to place a bet by entering the amount of BTC you wish to risk in the space labelled “Bet Amount”. Currently, betting limits are set per game (0.001 BTC minimum).  Click on the 'Rules' button to see the maximum bet amount for that variant.</p></li>

								<li><p><em>The Deal</em> The player and dealer are initially dealt two cards each, with the dealer leaving one of its two cards exposed to the view of the player. </p></li>

								<li><p><em>Playing a Hand</em> The player will always have the opportunity to play his/her hand before the dealer. In blackjack, you have several options on how to play each hand.</p></li>

								<li><p><em>Surrender</em>
									If this option is used by a player, his/her hand is folded and a certain percentage of the initial bet returned.
									Please click the 'Rules' button on the Blackjack page to find out exactly how much is returned for that variant.
								</p></li>
								<li><p><em>Hit/Stand</em>
									To hit or to stand is the most common decision that a blackjack player must make.
									Once you examine the two cards you have been dealt, you must decide if you will “hit”
									(be dealt another card) or “stand” (remain with the total of the cards in your hand).
									As a player, you can choose to “hit” as many times as you wish, but remember, as soon
									as the total of the cards in your hand goes over 21, you “bust” and lose that hand.
								</p></li>
								<li><p><em>Double Down</em>
									Doubling down gives a player the chance to bet twice the amount of the originally placed wager.
									Once a player chooses to “double-down”, they will receive one (and only one) more card to their hand.
									If that player busts, or loses to the dealer’s hand, all monies risked will be lost. If the player wins,
									they will receive back twice what they risked. The time a user is allowed to Double Down depends on the
									rule variant you are playing. Please click the 'Rules' button on the Blackjack page to find out exactly
									when you are allowed to Down Down for that variant.
								</p></li>
								<li><p><em>Split</em>
									The option to split pairs can be one of the more interesting parts of blackjack.
									Players who are dealt a pair of equally valued cards to their hand (i.e. two 4s or a 10 & K) have the option to split them up,
									and play each card as two separate hands. If a player receives another pair with the split,
									that hand can also be split if the player so chooses (depending on the Blackjack variant being played,
									the player may or may not be allowed to resplit Aces).
									An additional wager, equal to the amount of the initial bet, will be placed for each extra hand.
									The maximum number of times a user can split depends on the rule variant you are playing,
									as does the times at which a player can Double Down after splitting.
									Please click the 'Rules' button on the Blackjack page to find out exactly how many splits are allowed, when
									Doubling Down after a split is allowed, and whether resplitting Aces is allowed for that variant.
								</p></li>
								<li><p><em>Insurance</em>
									When the dealer’s show card is an ace, players will have the option of taking out insurance.
									Before any further plays are made, a player has the option to make an insurance bet of half the value of their initial bet.
									If the dealer reveals that its hidden card has a value of 10, making its hand a blackjack, the insurance bet pays out
									at a ratio determined by the game variant. If the dealer has a hidden card with a value other than 10, the insurance bet is
									lost and the hand must be played out as normal. Essentially, this is an opportunity for a player to protect themselves against
									losing their initial wager to a potential blackjack for the dealer.
									Please click the 'Rules' button on the Blackjack page to find out what the insuranace payout ratio is for that variant.
								</p></li>

								<li><p><em>Blackjack</em>
									A “blackjack” refers to being dealt a natural 21 (a total of 21 in a two card hand).
									A blackjack will always be, therefore, an ace and any other card with a value of ten.
									A blackjack will beat any dealer hand besides another blackjack (in which case the hand is a tie).
									Please click the 'Rules' button on the Blackjack page to find out what the Blackjack payout ratio is for that variant.
								</p></li>

								<li><p><em>Dealer Play</em>
									In a game of blackjack, the dealer will always play out its hand after the player has had a
									chance to complete his/her hand.
									The dealer will play its hand based on odds and predictability, just as any player might.
									In almost all cases, the dealer will stand on a hand of 17, and continue to hit until it
									has reached at least that mark.
									<br><br>
									The sole exception to the rule of standing on 17 is if it is a “soft” or “hard” 17.
									A soft 17 is a 17 which contains at least one ace (Ex: A/6 OR A/2/4 OR A/5/A).
									Please click the 'Rules' button on the Blackjack page to find out if the dealer hits on a soft 17
									for that variant.

								<li><p><em>What is Provably Fair?</em>
									At SynergySports, we take the ideals of fair play seriously and verify our casino blackjack feature through provably fair software.
									<br><br>
									Provably fair software enables each user to independently verify the authenticity of every automated shuffle conducted by SynergySports. This ensures that players can test each shuffle through an independent and objective system, and be satisfied of the fairness of the game at all times.
								</p></li>

								<li><p><em>How Does it Work?</em>
									SynergySports provably fair software uses a function called cryptographic hash. The approach is built to ensure that neither the site nor the player will ever know how a deck will be shuffled until after the deal has been made.
									<br><br>
									In order to understand this method of verifying and proving that SynergySports is playing fair; the process is outlined and simply explained below. These steps are taken before a hand is dealt:
								</p>
								<div>
									<ul>
										<li>SynergySports servers create new decks and shuffle them through the use of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher-Yates shuffle</a> algorithm and the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister">Mersenne Twister</a> RNG.</li>
										<li>Also using Mersenne Twister, the server comes up with random strings of numbers, called the server seed. The server seed and a string representing the cards in the deck are then combined to create a single encoded string. The outcome is then referred to as the ‘secret’.</li>
										<li>The secret is then hashed through the utilization of the one-way hashing algorithm, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA256</a>. The value will then be shown to the player prior to the hand being dealt.</li>
										<li>At this point, the player can enter a 'client seed' and start a new game.</li>
										<li>Now, the server will combine the client seed and the server seed as the basis for shuffling the deck once again.</li>
										<li>Finally, the hands are dealt and the game is played out as normal.</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									Once the game is finished, you will be able to verify fairness by clicking on the 'Provably Fair' button and clicking the 'Calculate' button - this will process all of the data to determine fairness and give a result.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li><p><em>Independently Verifiable</em>
								Our implementation for determining fairness is freely available as Javascript code. You can inspect the code yourself to ensure it is
								accurate.
							</p></li>

							<li><p><em>Cheating</em>

								Any form of cheating is strictly prohibited, and SynergySports will vigorously pursue and investigate any suspicious activities. SynergySports reserves the right to lock the account of any user found to be cheating and seize any funds in that account.

							<li><p><em>Where is my BTC balance for blackjack?</em>

								You play blackjack with your pre-existing SynergySports bitcoin balance, available for view at the top right-hand side of your browser. Any changes to that balance through playing blackjack (wins or losses) will be reflected in that main balance.
							</p></li>
							<li><p><em>Why is my balance not updating?</em>

								Your main Synergy account balance should update after each hand of blackjack played. While the updates should be reflected quickly, it may not always be instantaneous if there is heavy volume. Please allow a few seconds for the balance to update. If your balance has not updated for a significant period of time (a couple of minutes) please contact support and they will be happy to assist you.
							</p></li>

							<li><p><em>How does provably fair software work?</em>

								Provably fair is standard for bitcoin casino games, including blackjack. It provides a means by which users can independently verify the fairness of a game through examining the deal after every hand. For more information on provably fair, please see “Fair Play” under the blackjack rules tab.
							</p></li>
							<li><p><em>How does SynergySports make money on blackjack?</em>

								SynergySports collects no rake or “off the top” percentage of the blackjack played here. It is simply you and the dealer playing!
							</p></li>
							<li><p><em>Why will my Synergy Blackjack feature not load?</em>

								Your blackjack feature should load immediately upon selection of “Blackjack” under the casino tab at the left side of your browser. If it will not load consistently, try simple tricks such as refreshing the page, restarting your browser or trying a different browser. If problems persist please reach out to support.
							</p></li>
							<li><p><em>What are the wagering limits?</em>

								When playing blackjack, the minimum wager amount is 0.001 BTC and the maximum depends on the game variant.  Click on the 'Rules' button to see the maximum bet amount for that variant.
							</p></li>
							<li><p><em>I find chat at the top of the browser distracting, can I get rid of it?</em>

								Yes! If you’re finding chat distracting while playing blackjack, you can minimize and then eliminate it entirely by selecting the X on the chat bar. If you want to get chat back after you are done playing, simply refresh your browser and it will reappear.
							</p></li>

							<li><p><em>I keep having problems, and they just won’t go away! How can I contact support?</em>

								If you are having persistent problems that are resisting quick fixes, our best-in-the-industry support team will be happy to help you out.

							<br>
							Dice is a game of random chance where wagers are based on whether you think the value of a roll will end up higher or lower than a preset number between 0 and 99.99 inclusive.  What makes it the game of choice for bettors worldwide is that you control the odds, not just the wagers.  You set the “Chance of Winning” as a percentage, between 0.01 and 98.0, which, in turn, establishes the number in which you must end up either above or below your choice. 

							<br><br>

							By adjusting the various fields you can alter the odds, and subsequent winnings, to be lower but with less risk, or higher, but with greater risk/reward.

							<br><br>

							Fields that can be adjusted include:
						</p>

						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>Bet Amount (how much you want to risk).</li>
								<li>Win Chance (a number representing the % chance to win between 0.01 and 98).</li>
								<li>Payout (the payout odds that will be applied to the bet).</li>
								<li>Whether you want to choose lower or higher.</li>
							</ul>

							<br>

							By altering one field, the others adjust automatically, giving you the odds and amounts needed to accomplish your desired outcome, should you guess correctly.
						</div>
						<br>

						At Synergy, we believe in your right to be able to independently verify the fairness of every roll of the dice on our site.
						<br><br>
						To roll a number between 0 - 99.99, we combine a Server Seed, your Client Seed, and a <a href="#" id="nonce-tooltip">Nonce</a> with hmac-sha512(server_seed, client_seed-nonce). This generates a hexadecimal string.
						<br><br>
						We take the first 5 characters from the hexadecimal string, and convert it from a hexadecimal to a decimal value. If this decimal value is over 999,999 then the next 5 characters are used. Next step, we apply a modulus of 10^4  and divide it by 10^2 to obtain a number that’s 0-99.99.
						<br><br>
						Here's how you can verify each roll:
						<br><br>

						<ol>
							<li><p>Set your desired parameters (i.e. bet amount, payout, win, high/low). </p></li>
							<li><p>If you'd like to update your client seed before rolling, click the “Provably Fair” button. If you've already rolled and would like to update your Client Seed again, you'll have to click the “Change Client Seed” button before you can edit the field.</p></li>
							<li><p>This is also where you can see the hash of your server seed. The server seed is generated before you set your Client Seed so you know that it hasn't been manipulated after you make your choice.</p></li>
							<li><p>Now, click to roll the dice!</p></li>
							<li><p>After your roll, click the Provably Fair button again to generate a new Client Seed.</p></li>
							<li><p>Now, under “My Bets,” just find the roll that you want to check, and select “verify”. Here, you can view all necessary game information, including: client seed, nonce, server seed, server seed hash, and roll. </p></li>
							<li><p>Select the “calculate” button below the above information to find out if your roll was fair!</p></li>
							<li><p>Select “external verification” to be sent to a site where you can independently use the roll information to fill in the fields provided, and confirm that fair play standards are being met. </p></li>

							<li><p><em>Will my bet amount reset every roll?</em>
								No. Once entered, your bet amount and other roll settings will remain the same until you choose to change it. However if you leave the dice game and come back at a later time, your bet amount and other roll settings may be reset to default values. Always ensure your roll settings are correct before rolling.
							</p></li>

							<li><p><em>Why can't I withdraw my 0.00032 BTC?</em>
								The minimum withdrawal amount at SynergySports is 0.001 BTC. Keep on winning and you'll get there soon!

							<li><p><em>Am I able to see a history of my previous wagers?</em>
								Definitely! When playing dice, you can select the “My Bets” button to view your last 50 rolls. You can see your entire history under “My Casino Wagers” tab in the “Synergy" menu. The record lets you know what you bet, when, how much, the outcome, your profit, and also allows you to verify the fairness of each hand.
							</p></li>

							<li><p><em>How does the counter work?</em>
								The counter (or wheel) at the center of your screen is a visual representation of your roll. The space around the wheel proportionally represents possible numbers from 0 to 99.99. As soon as you click “ROLL,” the wheel will begin to fill clockwise, and the larger numerical counter in the middle will keep up with the wheel as it fills. The smaller number in the circle outside of the wheel represents the number which you must roll over or under (depending on your wager type) to win. This number can be shifted depending on the “payout” or “win chance” you have selected.
							</p></li>

							<li><p><em>I rolled 49.5 exactly, why didn't I get paid out?</em>
								Your wager is on whether or not your roll will be higher or lower than the indicated win chance, not whether it will be equal-to or higher, or equal-to or lower than the indicated win chance.
