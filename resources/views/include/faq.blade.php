									<li><p><em>What is your minimum bet?</em>0.001 BTC</p></li>
									<li><p><em>What is your maximum bet?</em>Maximum bet amounts vary based on a lot of factors (like sport, league or how far away the start time is for example). For transparency, all of our limits are displayed next to the bet so that you know how much you can wager. This maximum "wager amount" can be either the RISK or the TO-WIN value. For example, if the maximum wager was displayed as 1.0 BTC, but the odds were (1.500/-200), you could still risk 2.0 BTC to win 1.0 BTC.</p></li>
									<li><p><em>I made a mistake with a bet, can you change it or cancel it?</em>As per our rules and terms; we can never change, modify or cancel any bet confirmed by a user. You must always check your betslip before confirming. If you are ever unsure about what wagers you have, you can check this under menu SynergySports -> My Wagers. You can also turn on email notifications to get an email for every wager you place. If you made a mikstake, you can always bet the other side of the wager to help negate your bet.</p></li>
									<li><p><em>Why is my wager not graded yet?</em>Some sports and leagues must have their results verified by our team to ensure correct results. Sports especially like eSports or foreign sports teams do not always have official pages, or sometimes the posted results are incorrect on one source and take multiple sources to verify the winner/outcome. Most prop bets require additional verification as well: please allow up to 12 hours for any prop bet to be graded.</p></li>
									<li><p><em>Why is my deposit not here yet?</em>99.9% of the time the deposit is not here it is because it has not actually been sent to us. A large number of services (exchanges, eWallets, etc) will create transactions, debit your "account" with them but not actually send coins into the blockchain until several hours later (we have seen as long as 72 hours in some rare cases).<br/><br/>You can confirm for yourself if funds have been sent by looking at the blockchain transaction ID by going to: https://blockchain.info/tx/insert-transacation-id-here<br/><br/>If you see your transaction in the blockchain and you do not see it in your SynergySports account, then try closing your browser and logging back in to your account again. If this still does not solve the issue, then create a support ticket and a member of our support team will help resolve the issue.</p></li>
									<li><p><em>How long do withdraws take?</em>Withdraws are very fast in most cases. Sometimes our security might detect that your account has been hacked or accessed by a 3rd party in which case your withdraw may need a manual review. If you make an eSports bet on your account then a manual process of the withdraw is needed. Please allow 24 hours for any withdraw needing review. In rare cases, withdrawals could take upwards of 24 hours to be processed.
										<li><p><em>How do you decide on the odds to offer?</em>Our odds are grabbed from various sources and are also subject to change depending on any action we receive on a particular game. If you find lower juice offered elsewhere, please let us know by creating a support ticket so that we can remain competitive.</p></li>
										<li><p><em>Why are your limits low, I want to wager more?</em>Typically, limits will get raised closer to the start time; check back before the event starts for higher limits. If limits before start time are still not as high as you would like then let us know by creating a support ticket (with all details like sport, league and wager type)! We will take your ticket into consideration when deciding on which sports and leagues to focus on raising our limits in the future.</p></li>
										<li><p><em>What do I do if I have a problem that I couldn't solve after reading this FAQ, the Rules page and the Terms page or what if I just have a feature I want to request?</em>Create a support ticket. You can do this through the menu on the left under SynergySports -> Support.</p></li>

										<li><p><em>What is a Free Bet?</em>
											A "free bet" grants the user ONE (1) free bet up to the risk amount listed (including parlays). Your balance will not be affected by placing a free bet. If this bet wins, the "to win" amount will be credited to your account. If the bet loses your account balance will not change. This free bet will show up as 0.00 BTC stake on your My Wagers page. <strong>You do not receive back the "risk" amount if the bet wins, as the risk amount for any free bet is 0.00.</strong>				                            </p></li>
											<li><p>
												<em>How do I use a free bet?</em>To use a free bet, add wagers to your betslip as you would with any other bets. When you are ready to lock it in, you will see a new purple button underneath the existing "Place Wager" button which says "FREE BET!" followed by the amount it's worth. Clicking this button will highlight it, and give you a notice explaining how a Free Bet works. Make sure you set the "Risk" amount to the value of your free bet coupon. Once you have clicked "FREE BET" and highlighted it, you may click "Place Wager" and "CONFIRM WAGER" to lock it in.
